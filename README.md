How It Works Together:

1. Your bridge (main.py) runs and connects to the mining pool using pool_client.py.


2. When it receives a mining job, it uses emulator and execution engine to convert ASIC jobs to CPU-compatible tasks, applying your algorithm that includes network speed → virtual CPU power.


3. The bridge software then launches or communicates with XMRig inside the /xmrig folder (this integration code you add or build).


4. XMRig performs actual RandomX CPU mining, consuming real CPU power.


5. The bridge software submits shares generated by XMRig to the mining pool.


6. The terminal_ui.py shows mining progress and stats on your screen.

Deep Bio of the Setup and Software

Purpose

This software suite is designed as a custom ASIC-to-CPU mining bridge for Monero (or other RandomX coins). It aims to emulate ASIC job formats and translate them to CPU mining tasks, augmented by a novel approach that leverages network speed as a form of virtual CPU power — effectively simulating a hybrid mining resource model.

Core Components

ASIC Emulator (emulator.py)
Simulates ASIC hashing behavior on CPUs by translating ASIC algorithms into CPU-computable tasks. It integrates a custom algorithm that converts measured network throughput into additional “virtual CPU hashes” to boost mining simulation.

Execution Engine (execution_engine.py)
Runs the main mining loop combining CPU and virtual CPU power. Fetches mining jobs, calculates effective hash power, and attempts mining shares with the emulator.

Network Modules (pool_client.py, share_submitter.py)
Manage communication with Monero mining pools — retrieving mining jobs and submitting valid shares.

Diagnostics and Utilities (diagnostics.py, logger.py)
Handle system health checks, measure network speed, log mining events, and monitor performance.

Terminal UI (terminal_ui.py)
Provides a simple command-line interface for real-time mining status, controls, and statistics.

XMRig Integration (to be added)
Acts as the real mining backend, performing true RandomX calculations on CPU hardware. The bridge passes processed jobs to XMRig, which mines efficiently and returns share results.


Unique Features

Network-to-CPU Power Conversion:
The bridge measures real-time network throughput and converts it into a “virtual CPU hash rate” that combines with actual CPU hashes. This concept is experimental and simulative — the Monero network does not accept network speed as mining power but it helps create a unique hybrid mining model for private or experimental use.

Customizable and Extendable:
The modular folder and code structure lets you plug in any backend miner (like XMRig) or replace emulator modules with other mining algorithms.

Cross-Platform Potential:
While currently Windows-focused (due to XMRig binaries), the codebase is in Python, making it portable to Linux or macOS with minimal changes.


Use Cases

Experimental mining research, blending network metrics with CPU power

Educational tool for mining algorithm exploration

Custom private mining networks or blockchains adopting hybrid resource proofs

Prototype for advanced ASIC-to-CPU translation layers

Summary

You just need to add the official or customized XMRig executable and config inside /xmrig/ to leverage its powerful RandomX mining engine, while your bridge manages the hybrid ASIC-to-CPU conversion and network-based virtual power enhancements.
